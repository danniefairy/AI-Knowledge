Here's a **well-structured guide** that covers all aspects of **processes, threads, concurrency, preemptive vs. cooperative multitasking, scheduling policies, usage scenarios, race conditions, and example code** in Python.

# **Complete Guide to Processes, Threads, and Concurrency in Python**

## **1. Fundamental Concepts**
### **🔹 What is a Process?**
A **process** is an independent program running on a computer with:
- Its **own memory space**.
- A separate **set of system resources**.
- A unique **Process ID (PID)**.
  
✅ **Best for**: Running CPU-intensive tasks in **parallel** on multiple CPU cores.

### **🔹 What is a Thread?**
A **thread** is a lightweight execution unit **within a process** that:
- **Shares memory** with other threads in the same process.
- Can execute **concurrently** with other threads.
- Is limited by the **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** in Python.

✅ **Best for**: Handling **I/O-bound** tasks where waiting time dominates (e.g., network requests).

### **🔹 What is Concurrency?**
Concurrency means **handling multiple tasks at once**, but not necessarily at the same time. Two common ways to achieve this:
- **Multithreading (thread-based concurrency)**
- **Async programming (coroutine-based concurrency with `asyncio`)**

✅ **Best for**: Running **many** I/O-bound tasks (e.g., downloading multiple files).

### **🔹 What is Parallelism?**
Parallelism is **true simultaneous execution** of multiple tasks using **multiple CPU cores**.

✅ **Best for**: **CPU-intensive** tasks like image processing, data analysis.

## **2. Preemptive vs. Cooperative Multitasking**
| Feature | **Preemptive Multitasking** | **Cooperative Multitasking** |
|---------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Who controls task switching?** | OS (Kernel) | Developer (`await`) |
| **Can a task be interrupted?** | ✅ Yes (OS enforces time limits) | ❌ No (task must yield voluntarily) |
| **Examples** | **Processes, Threads** | **Coroutines (`asyncio`)** |
| **Best For?** | CPU-bound tasks (heavy computation) | I/O-bound tasks (web requests, file I/O) |

✅ **Example of Preemptive Scheduling (OS-controlled)**
```python
import threading
import time

def task(name):
    print(f"Thread {name} started")
    time.sleep(2)
    print(f"Thread {name} finished")

t1 = threading.Thread(target=task, args=("A",))
t2 = threading.Thread(target=task, args=("B",))

t1.start()
t2.start()

t1.join()
t2.join()
```
- The **OS schedules** thread execution.
- Threads **switch automatically**.

✅ **Example of Cooperative Scheduling (`asyncio`)**
```python
import asyncio

async def task(name, delay):
    print(f"Task {name} started")
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)  # Yield control
    print(f"Task {name} finished")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(task("A", 2), task("B", 1))

asyncio.run(main())
```
- The **event loop** only switches tasks at `await` points.

## **3. Scheduler Policies (OS Scheduling)**
Modern OS schedulers **decide which process runs next** using various strategies.

### **🔹 Common Scheduling Policies**
| Policy | Description | Example Usage |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| **First Come First Serve (FCFS)** | Runs tasks in arrival order | Background tasks |
| **Shortest Job Next (SJN)** | Prefers shorter tasks first | Low-latency applications |
| **Round Robin (RR)** | Each process gets a fixed time slice | Time-sharing systems |
| **Priority Scheduling** | Runs higher-priority tasks first | Real-time OS, critical services |
| **Multilevel Queue Scheduling** | Groups tasks into priority queues | OS kernel vs. user applications |

✅ **Check Process Priority in Linux**
```bash
ps -eo pid,pri,nice,cmd --sort=-pri | head
```
✅ **Change Process Priority**
```bash
renice -10 -p 1234  # Increase priority of process 1234
```

✅ **Simulating Round Robin Scheduling in Python**
```python
import time
import queue

processes = queue.Queue()
tasks = [("A", 3), ("B", 5), ("C", 2)]  # (Process, Execution Time)

for task in tasks:
    processes.put(task)

time_slice = 2  

while not processes.empty():
    name, remaining_time = processes.get()
    if remaining_time > time_slice:
        print(f"Running {name} for {time_slice} seconds...")
        time.sleep(time_slice)
        processes.put((name, remaining_time - time_slice))  # Add back
    else:
        print(f"Running {name} for {remaining_time} seconds (completed).")
        time.sleep(remaining_time)
```

## **4. Using Scenarios**
| Task Type | Best Approach |
|-----------|--------------|
| **CPU-bound (e.g., heavy calculations)** | ✅ `multiprocessing` (OS-managed, parallel execution) |
| **I/O-bound with blocking calls (e.g., file I/O, web requests)** | ✅ `threading` (OS-managed, concurrency) |
| **I/O-bound with non-blocking calls (e.g., async APIs, DB queries)** | ✅ `asyncio` (User-managed, cooperative) |
| **Need true parallelism?** | ✅ `multiprocessing` (bypasses GIL) |
| **Want lightweight concurrency?** | ✅ `asyncio` (efficient but requires `await`) |

---

## **5. Race Conditions & Remediation**
### **🔹 What is a Race Condition?**
A race condition happens when **multiple threads/tasks modify a shared resource** unpredictably.

### **🔹 Example of Race Condition in `asyncio`**
```python
import asyncio

counter = 0

async def increment():
    global counter
    for _ in range(10000):
        temp = counter
        await asyncio.sleep(0)  # Forces a context switch
        counter = temp + 1  # Non-atomic operation

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(increment())
    task2 = asyncio.create_task(increment())

    await task1
    await task2

    print(f"Final counter value: {counter}")  # Expected: 20000, but may be lower!

asyncio.run(main())
```

### **🔹 Fixing Race Conditions**
✅ **Solution 1: Use `asyncio.Lock`**
```python
import asyncio

counter = 0
lock = asyncio.Lock()

async def increment():
    global counter
    for _ in range(10000):
        async with lock:  # Ensures exclusive access
            counter += 1

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(increment())
    task2 = asyncio.create_task(increment())

    await task1
    await task2

    print(f"Final counter value: {counter}")  # Correct: 20000

asyncio.run(main())
```

✅ **Solution 2: Use `multiprocessing.Value` for Shared Data**
```python
import multiprocessing

def increment(counter):
    for _ in range(10000):
        with counter.get_lock():
            counter.value += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    counter = multiprocessing.Value("i", 0)  # Shared integer with lock
    p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=increment, args=(counter,))
    p2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=increment, args=(counter,))

    p1.start()
    p2.start()

    p1.join()
    p2.join()

    print(f"Final counter value: {counter.value}")  # Correct: 20000
```

---

## **6. Summary**
- **Processes**: Independent memory, true parallelism, good for CPU-heavy tasks.
- **Threads**: Shared memory, best for I/O-heavy tasks, limited by GIL.
- **Concurrency (`asyncio`)**: Efficient I/O handling via cooperative multitasking.
- **Preemptive OS scheduling**: OS decides when to switch tasks.
- **Cooperative scheduling**: Tasks must `await` manually.
- **Avoid race conditions**: Use `Lock`, `Queue`, or `multiprocessing.Value`.
