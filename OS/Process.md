# **📌 Comprehensive Guide to Process Management in Operating Systems**

Process management is a core function of an **Operating System (OS)** that handles the execution of processes, resource allocation, scheduling, and synchronization. This guide covers **process vs. thread, concurrency vs. parallelism, process scheduling, IPC, synchronization, and deadlocks**, with **Python examples** comparing multiprocessing, threading, and asyncio.

## **1️⃣ Process vs. Thread**
### **🔹 What is a Process?**
A **process** is an instance of a program in execution. Each process:
- Has its **own memory space**.
- Has **separate system resources** (CPU, I/O).
- Can run multiple **threads** inside it.

### **🔹 What is a Thread?**
A **thread** is the smallest execution unit inside a process. Each thread:
- Shares memory **with other threads in the same process**.
- Runs **independently** but cannot truly execute in parallel due to **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** in Python.

### **🔹 Key Differences**
| Feature | Process | Thread |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Memory Space** | Separate | Shared |
| **Execution Speed** | Slower (higher overhead) | Faster (lightweight) |
| **Communication** | Inter-Process Communication (IPC) needed | Shared memory (easier but riskier) |
| **Context Switching** | Expensive | Cheaper |
| **Best for** | **CPU-bound tasks** | **I/O-bound tasks** |

✅ **Example: Process vs. Thread in Python**
```python
import multiprocessing
import threading
import time

def process_task():
    print("Process started")
    time.sleep(2)
    print("Process ended")

def thread_task():
    print("Thread started")
    time.sleep(2)
    print("Thread ended")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Using Process
    process = multiprocessing.Process(target=process_task)
    
    # Using Thread
    thread = threading.Thread(target=thread_task)

    process.start()
    thread.start()

    process.join()
    thread.join()
```
- **Processes are completely independent** (heavier).
- **Threads share memory** (faster but may cause race conditions).

## **2️⃣ Concurrency vs. Parallelism**
### **🔹 What is Concurrency?**
- **Multiple tasks appear to run simultaneously** but not necessarily at the same time.
- **Threading** and **async programming** use concurrency.

### **🔹 What is Parallelism?**
- **Multiple tasks run truly simultaneously** on multiple CPU cores.
- Achieved using **multiprocessing**.

### **🔹 Key Differences**
| Feature | Concurrency | Parallelism |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Execution** | Tasks **overlap** (may not run at the same time) | Tasks **run at the same time** |
| **Achieved via** | Threads, asyncio | Multiple processes |
| **Best for** | I/O-bound tasks | CPU-bound tasks |

✅ **Example: Concurrency (Threading) vs. Parallelism (Multiprocessing)**
```python
import threading
import multiprocessing
import time

def task():
    print("Task started")
    time.sleep(2)
    print("Task completed")

# Concurrency (Threading)
threads = [threading.Thread(target=task) for _ in range(2)]

# Parallelism (Multiprocessing)
processes = [multiprocessing.Process(target=task) for _ in range(2)]

# Start threads
for t in threads:
    t.start()
for t in threads:
    t.join()

# Start processes
for p in processes:
    p.start()
for p in processes:
    p.join()
```
- **Threads share memory and run "concurrently" (interleaved execution).**
- **Processes run in "parallel" on multiple CPU cores.**

## **3️⃣ Process Scheduling**
### **🔹 What is Process Scheduling?**
The OS scheduler decides **which process gets CPU time** based on scheduling policies.

### **🔹 Process Scheduling Types**
1. **Long-Term Scheduler** → Selects which processes enter the ready queue for execution and ensures that the system does not get overloaded with too many processes.
2. **Short-Term Scheduler (CPU Scheduler)** → Decides which process to execute next.
3. **Medium-Term Scheduler** → Suspends/resumes processes to free resources.

### **🔹 CPU Scheduling Criteria**
| Criteria | Description |
|----------|------------|
| **CPU Utilization** | Maximize CPU usage |
| **Throughput** | Maximize completed processes per second |
| **Turnaround Time** | Minimize total execution time |
| **Waiting Time** | Minimize time spent in the ready queue |
| **Response Time** | Minimize time between request and first response |

### **🔹 CPU Scheduling Algorithms**
| Algorithm | Description | Preemptive? | Best for |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **FCFS** | First Come First Serve | ❌ No | Batch Systems |
| **SJF** | Shortest Job First | ✅ Yes | Short Jobs |
| **Round Robin** | Each process gets a fixed time slice | ✅ Yes | Time-sharing systems |
| **Priority Scheduling** | Higher priority jobs run first | ✅ Yes | Critical tasks |
| **Multilevel Queue** | Different queues for foreground/background processes | ✅ Yes | Multi-user systems |

✅ **Example: Simulating Round Robin Scheduling in Python**
```python
import queue
import time

tasks = queue.Queue()
processes = [("A", 5), ("B", 8), ("C", 3)]  # (Process, Execution Time)

for process in processes:
    tasks.put(process)

time_slice = 2  # Time quantum

while not tasks.empty():
    name, time_left = tasks.get()
    if time_left > time_slice:
        print(f"Running {name} for {time_slice} seconds...")
        time.sleep(time_slice)
        tasks.put((name, time_left - time_slice))  # Put back in queue
    else:
        print(f"Running {name} for {time_left} seconds (completed).")
        time.sleep(time_left)
```

## **4️⃣ Process States & Context Switching**
### **🔹 Process States**
1. **New** → Process is created.
2. **Ready** → Waiting for CPU.
3. **Running** → Executing instructions.
4. **Waiting** → Waiting for I/O.
5. **Terminated** → Execution completed.

### **🔹 Context Switching**
- **The OS saves/restores process state** when switching between tasks.
- Expensive for **processes**, cheaper for **threads**.

---

## **5️⃣ Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**
### **🔹 Why IPC?**
Since processes have **separate memory**, they need **IPC mechanisms** to communicate.

### **🔹 IPC Mechanisms**
| Method | Description |
|--------|------------|
| **Pipes** | Unidirectional communication |
| **Message Queues** | Asynchronous communication |
| **Shared Memory** | Fastest, but needs synchronization |
| **Sockets** | Network-based communication |

✅ **Example: IPC Using Queue in `multiprocessing`**
```python
import multiprocessing

def worker(queue):
    queue.put("Message from process")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    q = multiprocessing.Queue()
    p = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker, args=(q,))
    p.start()
    print(q.get())  # Retrieve message
    p.join()
```

---

## **6️⃣ Process Synchronization & Deadlocks**
### **🔹 What is a Deadlock?**
A **deadlock** occurs when processes wait indefinitely for each other's resources.

### **🔹 Deadlock Prevention**
- **Avoid circular wait** (assign resource priorities).
- **Use timeouts** (if a process waits too long, abort it).

✅ **Example: Avoiding Race Condition with Lock**
```python
import threading

counter = 0
lock = threading.Lock()

def increment():
    global counter
    for _ in range(10000):
        with lock:
            counter += 1

t1 = threading.Thread(target=increment)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=increment)

t1.start()
t2.start()

t1.join()
t2.join()

print("Final Counter:", counter)
```

---

## **🔹 Summary**
- **Use `multiprocessing` for CPU-bound tasks.**
- **Use `threading` for I/O-bound tasks.**
- **Use `asyncio` for efficient, cooperative multitasking.**
- **Prevent deadlocks with resource ordering and timeouts.**
