# **Operating System (OS) Basics – A Comprehensive Guide**

## **1. Introduction to Operating Systems**
An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that **manages hardware and software resources** and provides essential services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the hardware.

---

## **2. Types of Operating Systems**
Operating systems can be classified based on their functionality, structure, and use cases.

### **🔹 1. Batch Operating System**
A **Batch OS** processes jobs in batches without direct user interaction.
#### ✅ **Characteristics:**
- Users **submit jobs** to be processed later.
- No user interaction during execution.
- Uses **job scheduling** for efficient execution.
- Common in **mainframes and large-scale computers**.

#### 🖥 **Example Systems:**
- IBM OS/360
- Early MS-DOS (for simple batch jobs)

#### ⚡ **Advantages:**
✔ High efficiency for large jobs.  
✔ Reduces CPU idle time through batch execution.  

#### ❌ **Disadvantages:**
✖ Lack of user interaction.  
✖ Debugging is difficult since errors are reported later.  

---

### **🔹 2. Time-Sharing Operating System (Multitasking OS)**
A **Time-Sharing OS** allows multiple users or processes to use the CPU **simultaneously** by quickly switching between tasks.

#### ✅ **Characteristics:**
- Uses **CPU scheduling (Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, etc.).**
- Provides **interactive execution**.
- Reduces idle time of CPU and other resources.

#### 🖥 **Example Systems:**
- UNIX
- Windows
- macOS

#### ⚡ **Advantages:**
✔ Efficient resource utilization.  
✔ Fast user response time.  
✔ Supports multiple users concurrently.  

#### ❌ **Disadvantages:**
✖ Higher system complexity.  
✖ Requires powerful hardware.  

---

### **🔹 3. Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)**
A **Real-Time OS** is designed for systems that require **immediate response and strict timing constraints**.

#### ✅ **Characteristics:**
- Processes **must be completed within a strict deadline**.
- Used in **mission-critical** applications.
- Two types:  
  - **Hard RTOS** → Missed deadlines cause system failure (e.g., aircraft control).  
  - **Soft RTOS** → Occasional delays are tolerable (e.g., video streaming).  

#### 🖥 **Example Systems:**
- VxWorks  
- FreeRTOS  
- RTLinux  

#### ⚡ **Advantages:**
✔ Predictable and fast response time.  
✔ Ideal for critical systems (medical devices, automation).  

#### ❌ **Disadvantages:**
✖ Expensive and complex to develop.  
✖ Limited multitasking capability in Hard RTOS.  

---

### **🔹 4. Distributed Operating System**
A **Distributed OS** manages multiple independent computers, making them appear as a **single system**.

#### ✅ **Characteristics:**
- Multiple systems are **connected via a network**.
- **Resources are shared** among systems.
- Increases performance, fault tolerance, and scalability.

#### 🖥 **Example Systems:**
- Google’s Fuchsia OS  
- Microsoft Windows Server  
- Amoeba  

#### ⚡ **Advantages:**
✔ High fault tolerance and scalability.  
✔ Increased resource efficiency through distributed computing.  

#### ❌ **Disadvantages:**
✖ Requires a complex and fast network.  
✖ Security risks in a networked environment.  

---

### **🔹 5. Embedded Operating System**
An **Embedded OS** is designed for specialized devices **with limited hardware resources**.

#### ✅ **Characteristics:**
- Optimized for **specific tasks**.
- Uses **low-power, low-memory hardware**.
- Found in **consumer electronics, industrial control systems, IoT devices**.

#### 🖥 **Example Systems:**
- Android (for embedded devices)  
- Embedded Linux  
- QNX (used in automobiles and medical devices)  

#### ⚡ **Advantages:**
✔ Efficient performance for dedicated applications.  
✔ Low power consumption.  

#### ❌ **Disadvantages:**
✖ Limited ability to update or modify software.  
✖ Can be difficult to debug.

## **3. OS Components**
An operating system consists of several key components that manage hardware and software interactions.

### **🔹 1. Kernel (Core of the OS)**
The **kernel** is the **core component** of an OS that **manages system resources** and hardware interactions.

#### ✅ **Responsibilities:**
- **Process management** → Creates, schedules, and terminates processes.  
- **Memory management** → Allocates and deallocates memory.  
- **Device management** → Controls hardware devices via drivers.  
- **File system management** → Handles storage, retrieval, and updates.  

#### 🛠 **Types of Kernels:**
| Type | Description | Example OS |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Monolithic Kernel** | Large, single-layered kernel managing all services. | Linux, Unix |
| **Microkernel** | Minimal core kernel; other services run as separate modules. | QNX, macOS |
| **Hybrid Kernel** | Combination of monolithic and microkernel architecture. | Windows, macOS |

---

### **🔹 2. Shell (User Interface)**
The **shell** acts as an interface between the user and the OS.

#### ✅ **Types of Shells:**
| Type | Description | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Command Line Interface (CLI)** | Users enter commands via a text-based terminal. | Bash, PowerShell, Zsh |
| **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** | Users interact via graphical elements (windows, icons). | Windows Explorer, macOS Finder |

---

### **🔹 3. File System**
The **file system** manages data storage, organization, and retrieval.

#### ✅ **Common File System Types:**
| File System | Description | Used in |
|------------|------------|---------|
| **NTFS** | Secure, journaling file system | Windows |
| **FAT32** | Legacy, lightweight file system | USB drives, older Windows |
| **EXT4** | Standard Linux file system | Linux OS |
| **APFS** | Optimized for SSDs | macOS |

---

### **🔹 4. Device Drivers**
Device drivers allow the OS to communicate with hardware components (e.g., keyboards, printers, network cards).

#### ✅ **Types:**
- **Block device drivers** → Handle storage devices (HDD, SSD).  
- **Character device drivers** → Handle keyboards, mice, printers.  
- **Network drivers** → Handle communication over networks.  

✅ **Example: Checking Installed Drivers in Linux**
```bash
lsmod  # Lists all loaded kernel modules (drivers)
```

✅ **Example: Checking Installed Drivers in Windows**
```powershell
Get-WmiObject Win32_PnPSignedDriver | Select DeviceName, DriverVersion
```

---

## **4. System Calls**
System calls allow user applications to **request services from the OS kernel**.

### **🔹 Categories of System Calls**
| Category | Description | Example System Call |
|----------|------------|--------------------|
| **Process Control** | Create, terminate, manage processes | `fork()`, `exit()`, `exec()` |
| **File Management** | Open, read, write, close files | `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()` |
| **Device Management** | Request hardware access | `ioctl()`, `read()`, `write()` |
| **Memory Management** | Allocate, free memory | `malloc()`, `mmap()`, `free()` |
| **Networking** | Communicate over the network | `socket()`, `bind()`, `connect()`, `send()` |

✅ **Example: Making a System Call in Python**
```python
import os

pid = os.getpid()  # Calls system process API
print(f"Current Process ID: {pid}")
```

## **5. Summary**
| **Concept** | **Key Points** |
|------------|--------------|
| **OS Types** | Batch, Time-Sharing, Real-Time, Distributed, Embedded |
| **OS Components** | Kernel, Shell, File System, Device Drivers |
